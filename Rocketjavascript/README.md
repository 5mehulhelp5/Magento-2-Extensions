Don’t Let JS Slow Down Your Store
A lot of things load in the background when customers visit your website. JavaScript included. But not all JS is vital so it only delays the loading and increases the execution time.

Magento 2 Rocket JavaScript Extension fixes that.

Defer JS loading by moving all unnecessary JS to the bottom. Reduce the initial loading time and deliver your pages to customers faster!

Make Sure to Load Important JavaScript
When you defer the JavaScript loading you speed up a page rendering and define what JS to load later.

However, it doesn’t work for all pages. You might not want to defer JavaScript on the homepage or other CMS pages.

Exclude pages from the deferred JavaScript loading with the Magento 2 JavaScript Extension.

Make sure you load all vital JS and delay the loading of others.


Disable Deferred JS for Some Scripts
You should never rush to defer all JavaScript on your store since some of them might be initiated by an event, like GTM.

Keep all critical scripts at the top of the page using the Magento 2 Deferred JavaScript.

Just specify the JS strings to ignore and the extension will automatically add the data-rocketjavascript="false" attribute to all of them.
