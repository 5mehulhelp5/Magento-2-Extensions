Run CLI Commands from the Admin Panel
Usually, you should have some technical knowledge to run CLI commands. But not any more.

You don’t have to be a developer with the Magento 2 Command Line Interface extension.

Run the most used CLI commands directly from the admin panel WITHOUT TYPING.

Just press a few buttons and the extension will run the commands for you.


Run the Most Used Magento Commands
No need to install a terminal or access SSH to execute the most used CLI commands in Magento.

We have all of them gathered in one place.

Select the commands you use the most often and access them quickly through the CLI dashboard.


Restrict CLI Access for Different Users
Every admin user in your Magento 2 admin panel has different roles and responsibilities. But not all of them need to run CLI commands in your store.

Restrict users’ access to the Magento 2 CLI or choose only certain commands they can run.

Have full control of the users and CLI commands being executed in your admin.

Use Custom PHP Command
Have some custom php route you need to run the CLI commands?

No worries. You can still execute them with our Magento 2 CLI module.

All you need is to enter it in a corresponding PHP Command field and type it in the console. It will work like a charm!
