Currently, Magento 2 default does not activate a payment method for admin use only. In many cases, you will wish to have a payment method that you could assign to a backend order only and invisible on the checkout page in the frontend. For instance, sometimes, customers would like to make orders by phone or pay by money transfer or in-person cash. Therefore, this extension enables you to create orders from the backend and use the Magento payment method visible at the backend only.

Add a new Magento payment method for admin to create order in the backend

While expanding your Magento 2 with this extension, admin will still create the order as in default. In the Create New Order page, down to Choosing Payment Method step, you will see the admin payment method at the same area with other payment methods with a checkbox. Importantly, this method will appear only in the backend order page.
