This extension helps store owners to set up different prices (cost, regular, special prices, etc.) for the same product per store view.

By default, product prices can be configured to apply at either the global or website level.
If applied to the global level, the same price is used throughout the store hierarchy. If applied to the website level, the same product can be available at different prices from stores that are associated with different websites.

With this extension, product prices can also be configured at the store view level. This means the same product can have different prices per store view.
