This extension allows setting the maximum discount amount (upper limit) for a percentage-based cart rule.

Store owners run different promotional activities to attract customers and grow sales. One of the discounts they often want to use is percentage-based but with some limits (For example: Get 10% OFF but up to 50$ only)

By default, Magento doesn't have such a feature of setting the maximum amount of discount (upper limit) in the cart rule.
But with this extension, you are all set to go.
