Facebook Pixel - A Small Code Tells More Than Facebook Ads Results
At first, Facebook Pixel function was developed to track conversions from Facebook Ads to your websites so that you can optimize the ads, build targeted audiences and remarket the potential customers. Now, this main benefit is still right.

Then, if an action (say, searching or purchasing products) are taken either as the result of the ads or an organic reach, the pixel code will trigger and report this action to your Facebook Analytic. There are also several tools to check the results such as Facebook Pixel Helper.
