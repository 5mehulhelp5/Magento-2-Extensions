View product information in Quick View pop-up without page load
<br/>
===> Seeing a small version of one product page with the entire product attributes: name, SKU, prices, product description, and additional information. Shoppers will get every necessary information in one place!
<br/>
===> Stop customers from opening then backing a product page repeatedly. Now, one “Quick view” pop-up cost them only a few seconds to all the details briefed! Each pop-up is a “small size” product page

Also, customers can navigate to the product page from the Magento Quick View pop-up by clicking Go To Product link.


Add products to cart right from the “Quick view” pop-up
This is clever.

The “Add to cart” button has reduced two “suffering” actions: opening the product page & backing to the product list page. These two “must-have” actions really keep any users “drained out” while browsing around the shop. “Quick view” has “remove” this issue by allowing “add to cart” right from the pop-up. The shopping process could be faster than ever before with this improvement in customer experiences.

Customize text and design of Magento Quick View button
You will have flexible settings in the backend with options to change text, text color, and the button color
<br/>
===> Choose the right color to fit your website concept-or lead customers to click on the button right away with the “message” you deliver via the button’ text


Other Features
