Manage Cron Jobs in Magento Easily
While you might not notice cron jobs in your store, their workflow influences its performance immensely.

However, the main challenge occurs when you need to manage or reschedule them.

In default Magento, you need to access your store database for that. It slows down the effectiveness of the management and requires certain technical skills.

But not with the Magento 2 Cron Schedules extension. This solution enables you to manage cron jobs easily using admin panel grids.


View, Edit, Schedule and Execute Crons Task from the Admin
Since you don’t have to go to your store database, cron management in Magento becomes a breeze with our Magento 2 Cron Scheduler.

Filter through all the cron tasks in Magento or third-party extensions by method, group, instance and schedule in a few clicks.

Then easily edit, reschedule, enable or disable certain tasks in bulk to ensure optimal store performance.

No need to navigate anywhere else — manage all of your store cron tasks in one place!

Keep Track of All Magento Crons
Don’t know what Magento cron jobs have already been executed, which failed and which are still to be run?

Magento 2 Cron Schedule Extension gives you all these insights.

Navigate to the schedule log to find all the cron jobs neatly organized in a grid. Monitor when cron jobs are created, scheduled, executed and finished.

You can also sort cron jobs by the status and the error message if any.

Monitor Magento Cron Jobs Execution in a Timeline
If filtering through all the scheduled and executed tasks in the grid is not enough, you can also skim through the Cron Job TImelime.

It lists all scheduled, running and executed Magento cron jobs in chronological order.

Visual representation of each cron task helps you quickly determine when and at which time a certain cron job is processed. Moreover, you can obtain each cron task details on the mouse hover.

Magento 2 Cron Schedule Extension offers a completely new way of managing cron in Magento!


Eliminate Any Delays and Errors Timely
Although Magento 2 Cron Scheduler allows you to track the cron workflow for up to seconds, you won’t monitor your admin panel constantly.

That’s why it allows you to configure email notifications about any issues concerning Magento cron jobs.

Schedule cron job emails at the optimal time and get notified if something goes wrong or if any cron task is missed.

Get your cron jobs up and running and forget about troublesome database ways of handling them.
