Now anyone can add, edit and disable GTM tags without relying on webmasters or technical support.

Once you insert the Google Tag Manager tracking IDs in the admin, all eCommerce events are created automatically.

All you need is to export the JSON file with them to your Google Tag Manager account.

Then data about impressions, add-to-carts, purchases, refunds and other customer activities will be passed to Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics 4.

Getting insights about your store's performance is as simple as that.

Measure How Your Products Perform
Google Analytics E-commerce support enables you to get a concise picture of the performance of your products. Use Magento 2 Google Tag Manager Extension to track and analyse:

- product impressions and clicks by position (in search results and category pages)<br/>

- conversions (purchased products)<br/>

Increase the average order value and incorporate a new marketing strategy with proper data at hand.

Leverage Your Google Ads Campaigns
Magento Google Tag Manager Extension is all about making data tracking easier for you. So, if you want to improve the accuracy of your ads, use the Google Ads options of the extension.

Set up Dynamic Remarketing: display personalized ads with products and services people viewed on your website.
Enable Conversion Tracking: track orders made through the ads and assess the effectiveness of each campaign.

Benefit from Enhanced Conversions: capture the customer’s email address through the conversion tracking tags for better conversion measurement.

Track Checkout Behaviour
Checkout is one of the most important and decision-driving steps in customers' journey.

Although you’ve already optimized checkout on your store, Magento Google Tag Manager will make it better.

Discover how successfully customers moved through each checkout step.

Determine what might cause the cart abandonment.

Create checkout funnel visualisation to track all actions customers take on checkout.

Track All Conversions and Refunds in Your Store
To determine which sales and marketing strategies work the best you need to track conversions and refunds.

This Google Tag Manager allows you to monitor all orders in your store 一 made on the frontend or through the admin panel 一 along with the refunds.

You can also monitor coupon performance by source and medium. Learn how much revenue each coupon is generating and the total revenue per coupon with the Magento 2 GTM extension.

Monitor Customers' Shopping Behaviour
The customer shopping experience is key to better conversions. To create that experience you need advanced in-store behaviour tracking with Magento 2 Google Tag Manager.

Track every step in the customers’ journey and discover the bottlenecks that need to be eliminated.

- products viewed, added or removed from their shopping cart<br/>
- checkout steps completed successfully<br/>
- abandoned shopping carts and checkout process<br/>
- registered and signed-in customers (pages)<br/>
- customers that use search (pages and medium)<br/>

Enable Server-side Tracking
Although Magento Google Tag Manager is the ultimate tool for data tracking, some data might still be missing.

Your visitors don’t accept cookies, or simply use AdBlockers that prevent data from being collected. But not any more.

Enable the server side-tracking using GA4 Measurement Protocol or use Server Container to avoid this.

All eCommerce events will be sent from your Magento server directly to GTM or Google Analytics servers in HTTP requests. No customer data will be collected from the browser.

Track All Valuable Purchase Data
Tracking purchases is vital for your marketing and sales campaigns. However, it’s the details that matter most.

Use Magefan GTM Extension to track what products get purchased the most and how much revenue each generates. But there’s more.

The order details you get in the GA4 reports with this extension include:

- Order ID<br/>
- Currency<br/>
- Revenue<br/>
- Coupon code<br/>
- Items purchased<br/>
- Tax amount<br/>
- Shipping amount<br/>

Never Miss a Conversion
If customers use AdBlockers or don’t accept cookies their purchases are simply missed. This results in inaccurate data reports and ineffective campaigns. Is there a solution?

Magento 2 Google Tag Manager enables you to use server-side tracking only for missing orders.

You’ll capture every single purchase to leverage your marketing strategies while still using web container tracking.

Note: if you use a headless PWA storefront, you’ll benefit from the REST API endpoints our Magento 2 GTM Extension offers for server-side tracking.

Comply with Google Content Mode
Google is very responsible when it comes to protecting customers’ data and privacy. That’s why it introduces the Consent Mode which Magefan GTM Extension is compatible with.

If you use the default Magento Cookies Restriction Mode you can set consent paramenets to denied by default.

Then once a user specifies their consent choices, these parameters will be set to granted.

Comply with Google policies and collect only the data users allow you to.

Optimize GTM JavaScript Loading
Whenever you add any custom scripts to your store, you add extra time for these scripts to load.

Since website speed is one of the most important factors in the purchasing decision we made sure it is not altered.

Our Magento 2 GTM Extension comes with a speed optimization feature.

You can simply enable it from the backend and the GTM script will only be loaded after the first scroll, click or mouse touch.

Compatibility with Stape.io and Custom GTM Loaders
Do you use Stape.io service or any other custom GTM loader to improve data tracking through GTM?

You’d benefit from the ability to use the Web GTM code we offer.

You can choose to track data through Stape.io or other GTM loaders with BODY and HEAD scripts and gather valuable insights about store performance better.
