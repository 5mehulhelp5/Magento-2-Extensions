A successful case study of using our Magento 2 shipping extension.

Tommy runs a popular floral shop around West Yorkshire in nearly a decade!

To celebrate this 10th anniversary, he yearns for sending Britain and Netherlands clients 10-day free delivery on any order, regardless of quantity or weight.

Tommy highly favors for Admin Shipping Method- a free extension that only visible in the backend because it matches the demand for this occasion perfectly.

It works out for his staff, who receive orders made via phone calls, to generate orders and assigning this method in the backend; they are also able to designate this shipping method only for a list of customers living in Britain and Netherlands.

Moreover, Admin Shipping Method does not limit the minimum quantity of purchase in these promotion days.
