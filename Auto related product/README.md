Convince customers to buy at different stages of their journey.

Display related products on the Magento homepage, shopping cart and any other CMS page using a widget.

Display Multiple Offers at the Same Time
The better product recommendations, the more likely customers are to purchase. But you can also increase the chances by displaying multiple related product blocks.

Apply one or multiplerelated product rules to the same page and display entirely different items.

Satisfy every customer’s needs with the Magento 2 Automatic Related Products and display:

- Cross-sells<br/>
- Up-sells<br/>
- Best sellers<br/>
- New arrivals<br/>
- Related/featured/random products<br/>


Use Smart Product Recommendation Algorithm
Once you set up automatic related products in Magento, you don’t need to do a thing. 

The extension uses smart algorithms to detect items that fall under the conditions you set.

So, after you change any product information or auto related product rules, related product blocks are updated automatically.

Your customers will see only relevant product recommendations.

Set Up “Who Bought This Also Bought” Block
To harness the crowd wisdom and increase your cross-sells revenue you need to use the “Who Bought This Also Bought That” feature.

It shows products frequently bought together by customers who also bought the item currently being viewed.

It is similar to buying bundle packs of products that are bought together. And it is super easy to set up.

Manage Related Product Conditions in One Place
Choose between 20+ positions to display related products. Specify product, cart and page attributes a rule should be based on. 

Use a single “Same As” condition to relate products based on some specific attribute: same category, same colour, same brand, etc. All in one place.

Magento 2 Automatic Related Products Extension saves time by offering you straightforward management.

Display “Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed” Products
Purchasing decisions usually don’t come easy. Customers analyze a lot of factors before making a purchase.

Products others viewed or bought are at the top of the list. So, you should use that.

Magento 2 Auto Related Products Extension does the magic.

Just enable the “Who Viewed This Also Viewed That” block and the extension will do the rest.

Offer Related Products in Bundle Packs
Related products, cross-sells and up-sells increase the average order value and encourage customers to buy more.

However, the way you display them matters too.

That’s why Magento 2 Auto Related Product Extension comes with the “Frequently Bought Together template”.

Allow customers to purchase products in bundle packs and remove the items they don’t need in just one click.

Allow Customers to Compare Products
The Magento 2 compare product feature comes in handy if customers can’t decide and want to compare product features. Use it in your related products.

Just choose the "Compare Items" template for the related product blocks. 

Enable customers to compare prices, materials, manufacturers and other benefits right on the product page.

Help them make the right purchasing decision faster.

Display Best Sellers in Related Products

- Name<br/>
