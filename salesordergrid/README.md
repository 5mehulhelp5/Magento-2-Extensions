Feature Highlights
Display Total Amount
The extension enhances the order grid by showing total sales order amount of the visible records.
Also, text shown along with the total is configurable from the settings.

Colorful Order Status
One of the key features of this extension is the ability to convert plain text order statuses into colorful ones, which can be easily configured through the settings.

By implementing this feature, store admins can quickly identify and differentiate between orders using color, making order management a breeze.

Display Purchase Items
With this extension, you can easily enhance your sales order grid in admin by adding the Purchased Items column.

This feature gives you quick access to the purchased items without having to navigate to the order details page, saving you time and making order management more efficient.

Filter by Multiple Values
This extension enhances the default sales order filtering capability of Magento 2.

Now, instead of being limited to filtering by a single value of dropdown fields like payment method, store, or order status, store admins can easily filter by multiple values.

This makes it easier to manage orders and find the information needed quickly.

Add image support for "Purchase Items"
Color code rows in the grid to indicate order status at a glance
Bulk delete orders directly from the grid with ease
