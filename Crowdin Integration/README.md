Streamline Translation Process
Managing a multilingual store can be as simple as having a store in one language. Crowdin localization software, in combination with our Magento 2 Crowdin integration, can help you translate & manage your store in multiple languages. Translations are done in Crowdin by Crowdin Language Services, an agency of your choice, or your in-house translators. There's no vendor lock.

Synchronize Specific Products and Categories
Although our Crowdin Integration extension allows you to map Magento fields and export them to Crowdin in a few clicks, you don’t have to export all products and categories.
A handy Catalog Synchronization option helps you to define whether to export all or specific products and categories for translation in Crowdin. Manage translations more effectively and translate only those pages you need.

Create Multilingual Environment Easier
By default, Magento requires you to translate products and categories on a separate page or create completely new pages for each locale. This can be pretty overwhelming if you are translating a website into many languages.
Creating a multi-language website with the Crowdin Integration extension for Magento 2 is much easier since all the data is synchronized in real-time, tracked, and managed in one place. It creates an agile workflow and streamlines the localization process.

Synchronize Content Manually
There is no need for complex settings or techie configuration to create a better translation environment for your team. Magento 2 Crowdin Integration Extension is super easy to set up.
All you need is to activate the integration and choose what fields to sync with Crowdin for translation. Once the data is synchronized, you’ll be able to manually sync the data for translations back in the Crowdin tool and vice versa.

Schedule Automatic Data Synchronization
To optimize the process and reduce the manual work, Crowdin allows you to enable automatic data synchronization. You can import content for translation from Magento and export the translated files back at a scheduled time by clicking just one button.
This allows you to sync even the slightest changes like a new sentence or word in any of the content blocks. Automate content synchronization and deliver multilingual content to your global customers faster.
