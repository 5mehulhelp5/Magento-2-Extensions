Create Eye-Catching Product Labels
When we say our Magento 2 Product Label Extension allows you to create a unique offer for each product, we mean it. The extensive set of options allows you to create text-, shape- or image-based stickers just in a few clicks.

To save your time and reduce the workload on the admins we’ve created a library of 100+ Magento 2 product labels and badges for any occasion.

You can just download the ready-made product labels and apply them instantly in the backend.

Use catchy product stickers we provide to create unique offers and make each product stand out.

Apply Product Labels to Entire Catalog Automatically
Our Magento 2 Product Labels Extension ensures your product labels are both attractive and easy to manage.

You don’t need to apply them to all products manually and then spend hours editing if something changes.

The label's display is based on conditions. So you can apply labels to different products based on product category, SKU, manufacturer and any other product attribute.


Offer Something Unique for Each Product
The variety of Magento product label conditions helps you create a unique offer for each product. This makes customers more likely to find something that fits their needs.

Create product labels based on dynamic product attributes:

Price range — to highlight discounted products, hot deals, and items with low prices
Quantity range — to drive attention to products that are sold out quickly
Best sellers — to mark items that are purchased the most often
Most reviewed products — to display product badges for most reviewed items

Provide Personalized Offers
Sometimes it’s hard to satisfy each customer’s needs. But not with the Magento 2 Product Labels Extension.

You can show various product labels to different customer groups to personalize the offer.

Display hot deals for general customers, bulk purchase discounts to wholesalers and free shipping to premium customers.

Meet each customer's needs with eye-catching product labels.


Display Product Labels Dynamically
Marketing automation ensures you can get the results you want with little hassle. That’s exactly what our Magento 2 Product Labels Extension offers.

It works on the “set and forget” approach where you configure product label rules just once. The extension handles the rest.

You don’t need to enable or disable the product labels, once you configure the conditions.

Product labels are completely automated and change dynamically for each product as long as they fall into product label conditions.

Run Multiple Campaigns at the Same Time
The more you can offer your customers the more likely they are to accept the offer. Thus, running several marketing campaigns at the same time boosts your sales.

Magento 2 Product Labels Extension allows you to display multiple product badges on one product at the same time.

Just choose different positions for each badge and create irresistible offers.

Ensure the High Relevancy of Each Offer
A variety of conditions you create with the Magento 2 Product Labels Extension helps you cover a multitude of products.

While you can display multiple labels at the same time, it’s not always necessary.

To ensure product stickers are displayed consistently across your entire website, you can discard subsequent rules. Display only relevant product labels on one product page.

Same Time and Optimize Your Campaigns
Although Magento 2 Product Labels Extension already saves you tons of time, by handling the labels display automatically, there’s more.

If you want to change the product label position, status and priority or disable it, you can do it directly from the grid.

No need to go to each rule separately to tweak the basic settings. Use Magento 2 Product Labels Extension to the fullest with handy management features.

Adjust the Product Labels Design
To take Magento product labels to the next level you can adjust their design using your technical skills.

The extension uses HTML for text and shape labels and CSS for images. This allows you to tweak the design and make sure the labels are displayed as you see fit.

You can also choose a custom position for the product label display.
